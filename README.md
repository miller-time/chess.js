Chess.js
========

Pass-the-mouse Chess game in JS.

My first *big* programming project ever was a Chess game in C++ using the Borland compiler in Windows,
and a weird graphics library with a lot of boilerplate I didn't understand. My skills were as green as
a meadow, and my code ended up disgusting. The game, nevertheless, was buggy and unmaintainable.

For a long time I've wanted to try again. I'm going to use JQuery and regular objects to do it from
scratch, just for fun.
